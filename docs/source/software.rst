Building and Running Ubertooth Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For information on how to download, build and install the Ubertooth software and dependencies, see the `build guide <https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/wiki/Build-Guide>`__.

For an introduction on the capabilities of Ubertooth and how to use it, see the `getting started <https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/wiki/Getting-Started>`__ page.



Developing Host Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Host code is the software running on a host computer to which an Ubertooth One is attached via USB.

The Ubertooth developers use GCC on Linux. We aim to have the host code work on OSX systems, but we cannot guarantee it; if you find a bug, `please let us know <https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/issues>`__. Theoretically, host code could be written on or for other platforms, but it hasn't been done yet.

Although source can be found in the `release downloads <https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/releases>`__, you will probably want fresh code from `git <https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth>`__ if you plan to develop new code.
