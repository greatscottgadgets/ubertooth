Release 2020-12-R1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`for Release 2018-12-R1 see here <https://ubertooth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Release_2018-12-R1.html>`__



Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are some prerequisites that need to be installed before building libbtbb and the Ubertooth tools. Many of these are available from your operating system's package repositories, for example:



Debian 10 / Ubuntu 20.04 / Kali
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	.. code-block:: sh

		sudo apt install cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev make gcc g++ libbluetooth-dev wget \
		pkg-config python3-numpy python3-qtpy python3-distutils python3-setuptools



Fedora 33
+++++++++

	.. code-block:: sh

		sudo dnf install libusb1-devel make gcc gcc-c++ cmake wget tar bluez-libs-devel
		echo /usr/local/lib | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf



RHEL 8
++++++

	.. code-block:: sh

		sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
		sudo dnf install libusb1-devel make gcc gcc-c++ wget tar bluez-libs-devel python36 python36-devel
		echo /usr/local/lib | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf
		# Note: you will also need to install CMake 3.12.0 or greater. See https://cmake.org/install/



CentOS 8
++++++++

	.. code-block:: sh

		sudo dnf config-manager --enable powertools
		sudo dnf install libusb1-devel make gcc gcc-c++ wget tar bluez-libs-devel python36 python36-devel
		echo /usr/local/lib | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf
		# Note: you will also need to install CMake 3.12.0 or greater. See https://cmake.org/install/



Mac OS X users can use either MacPorts or Homebrew to install the required packages:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	.. code-block:: sh

		brew install libusb wget cmake pkg-config
		or
		sudo port install libusb wget cmake python38 py38-numpy py38-qtpy



FreeBSD users can install the host tools and library directly from the ports and package system:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	.. code-block:: sh

		sudo pkg install ubertooth



libbtbb
^^^^^^^

Next the Bluetooth baseband library (libbtbb) needs to be built for the Ubertooth tools to decode Bluetooth packets:

	.. code-block:: sh

		wget https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/libbtbb/archive/2020-12-R1.tar.gz -O libbtbb-2020-12-R1.tar.gz
		tar -xf libbtbb-2020-12-R1.tar.gz
		cd libbtbb-2020-12-R1
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..
		make
		sudo make install
		sudo ldconfig



Ubertooth Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Ubertooth repository contains host code for sniffing Bluetooth packets, configuring the Ubertooth and updating firmware. All three are built and installed by default using the following method:

	.. code-block:: sh

		wget https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/releases/download/2020-12-R1/ubertooth-2020-12-R1.tar.xz
		tar -xf ubertooth-2020-12-R1.tar.xz
		cd ubertooth-2020-12-R1/host
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..
		make
		sudo make install
		sudo ldconfig	



Wireshark plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users of Wireshark version 2.2+ do not need to build any plugins at all and may skip this section (see `this comment <https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/libbtbb/issues/50#issuecomment-284128258>`__). This includes users of Debian 10+, Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora 33+, RHEL 8.3+, and most other Linux distributions. You can check your version by clicking on Help --> About Wireshark.

Wireshark version 1.12 and newer includes the Ubertooth BLE plugin by default. It is also possible to `capture BLE from Ubertooth directly into Wireshark <https://ubertooth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/capturing_BLE_Wireshark.html>`__ with a little work.

The Wireshark BTBB and BR/EDR plugins allow Bluetooth baseband traffic that has been captured using Kismet to be analysed and disected within the Wireshark GUI. They are built separately from the rest of the Ubertooth and libbtbb software.

The directory passed to cmake as ``MAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`` varies from system to system, but it should be the location of existing Wireshark plugins, such as ``asn1.so`` and ``ethercat.so``. On macOS this is likely ``/Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/PlugIns/wireshark/``.

	.. code-block:: sh

		sudo apt-get install wireshark wireshark-dev libwireshark-dev cmake
		cd libbtbb-2020-12-R1/wireshark/plugins/btbb
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wireshark/libwireshark3/plugins ..
		make
		sudo make install	

Then repeat for the BT BR/EDR plugin:

	.. code-block:: sh

		sudo apt-get install wireshark wireshark-dev libwireshark-dev cmake
		cd libbtbb-2020-12-R1/wireshark/plugins/btbredr
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wireshark/libwireshark3/plugins ..
		make
		sudo make install



Third Party Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number of pieces of `third party software <https://ubertooth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/third_party_software.html>`__ that support the Ubertooth. Some support Ubertooth out of the box, while others require plugins to be built.



Firmware
~~~~~~~~

This completes the install of the Ubertooth tools, the next step is to look at the getting started guide. You should always `update the firmware <https://ubertooth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/firmware.html>`__ on the Ubertooth device to match the software release version that you are using.
