#. Profile BLE Advertising package introduction：

    * Payload data maximum length： 37 bytes

    * Advertising channels：37，38，39 （hopping）

    * Transmission power：usually 0dBm, Maximum 10dBm

	In each section below, pay attention on blue color marked portion (the raw data captured) and related data interpret portion（data interpretation）

#. Access Address It is fixed length (4 bytes) and fixed data (0x8e89bed6) used for master device access address identification.

#. Header Info Fixed 2 bytes：used by 16 bits BIT[0:3]：Advertising package（PDUs) type，there are following PDU Types：

	.. code-block:: sh

		 PDU Type
		 b3b2b1b0 Packet Name
		 0000 ADV_IND： connectable undirected advertising event
		 0001 ADV_DIRECT_IND：connectable directed advertising event
		 0010 ADV_NONCONN_IND：non-connectable undirected advertising event
		 0011 SCAN_REQ：scan request
		 0100 SCAN_RSP: scan response
		 0101 CONNECT_REQ：connection request
		 0110 ADV_SCAN_IND：scannable undirected advertising event
		 0111-1111 Reserved	

	BIT[4:5]：Reserved BIT[6]：RxAdd BIT[7]：TxAdd BIT[8:13]：advertising data length （Maximum 37 bytes) BIT[14:15]：Reserved

#. MAC Address Fixed 6 bytes

#. Advertising data：flag field 02 01 06 02：field length 2 bytes 　 01: as flag 06：BIT1,BIT2 = 1， based on definition below, interept as： 　　　* LE General Discoverable Mode
        
    * BR/EDR Not Supported (i.e. bit 37 of LMP Extended Feature bits Page 0)

	0 LE Limited Discoverable Mode 1 LE General Discoverable Mode 2 BR/EDR Not Supported (i.e. bit 37 of LMP Extended Feature bits Page 0) 3 Simultaneous LE and BR/EDR to Same Device Capa- ble (Controller) (i.e. bit 49 of LMP Extended Feature bits Page 0) 4 Simultaneous LE and BR/EDR to Same Device Capa- ble (Host) (i.e. bit 66 of LMP Extended Feature bits Page 1) 5..7 Reserved

#. Service tag field 03 03 02 18 03：field length 2 bytes 　 03: service tag field 02 18：=》18 02 => Immediate Alert Service

#. Device name field 0e 09 45 .... 6d 65 0e: field length 14 bytes 09：device name field 45，。。。6d 65: device name (ASCII)

#. CRC： Fixed 3 bytes
