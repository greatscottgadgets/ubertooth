Ubertooth 2017-03-R1 Release Notes
==============================
The Ubertooth host utilities in this release require libbtbb-2017-03-R1
(https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/libbtbb/releases/tag/2017-03-R1) or
greater.

Changes
-------
**USB API versioning** - We have added USB API versioning to improve the
experience of failures due to mismatched firmware and host code. You may find
that Ubertooth tools complain that your firmware is out of date.  Updating
firmware is simple and reliable, please follow the instructions on the wiki
https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/wiki/Firmware
A release archive with precompiled firmware is available from
https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/releases/download/2017-03-R1/ubertooth-2017-03-R1.tar.xz

**Basic Rate PCAP output** - the pcap file produced by the Ubertooth tools
should all be read by the latest Wireshark versions without the need to install
plugins.

**Kismet plugins** - Kismet is currently under heavy development and it has not
been possible to continue tracking the master branch.  The legacy Kismet plugins
should continue to work, but we will wait to track git master until development
has stabalised.

This release rolls up a lot of bug fixes, code tidying efforts, and small
enhancements, for a complete list of changes since the previous release, see the
git commit log.
