Ubertooth 2015-09-R1 Release Notes

The Ubertooth host utilities in this release require libbtbb-2015-09-R1 (https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/libbtbb/releases/tag/2015-09-R1) or greater.

These are just the highlights, for a complete list of changes since the
previous release, see the git commit log.

 * Basic Rate Bluetooth Improvements
  * Stability has improved in performance constrained environments
  * The "uh oh, buffer not emptied" issue no longer causes the tools to loop
    indefinitely
  * AFH support has greatly improved, UAP and CLK values are now found more
    quickly when AFH is used

 * Basic Rate PCAP support
  * ubertooth-rx and ubertooth-follow support a new PCAP file format
  * The new PCAP format is also supported with a new Wireshark plugin: btbredr
  * The PCAP format is still in the early stages, but we hope to have the plugin
    included in Wireshark later this year
  * The older btbb format is still produced by the Kismet plugins, they will
    be migrated over to the new format in the next release

 * Bluetooth Smart (BLE) Improvements
  * Improved packet reception
  * Promiscuous sniffing mode is more reliable
  * Promiscuous sniffing reports the recovered parameters to the host

 * Skateboard Hacking
  * Support for interfering with connections of BLE enabled skateboards
  * ubertooth-ego targets Yuneec E-go (not Bluetooth)
  * Always hack safely and responsibly!
